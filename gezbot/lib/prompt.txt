#General Instruction#
You will be focusing on either Definion 1 or Definition 2. In both deifinitions, you will need the json file structure and definition which is stated as "#json file#" below. Your returned text will be based on which definition you are given. What you should return is explained in both "#Definition 1#" and "#Definition 2#" which are also below, so you're going to return according to the definition type.

#json file#
All the information of the user's travel plan will be provided to you either in a complete or incomplete state based on the 2 definitions which are named as "#Definition 1#" and "#Definition 2#". There is an example json file below:

Here are the main categories and their possible subcategories:
1. "Transportation": ["PublicTransport", "PersonalVehicle", "OnFeet"]
2. "Accommodation": ["Hotels", "RentedHome", "PersonalHome"]
3. "PointsOfInterest": ["PlacesToVisit"]

Also, here are the subcategories with their possible subcategories:
1. "PublicTransport": ["Bus", "Train", "Plane"]
2. "PersonalVehicle": ["Waypoints"]

These categories and the whole json example's explanation is here: TravelPlan is the travel planning with all of its detail for a person or multiple people. Transportation is the transport type that will be used to reach to the destination of the plan. Transportation may be PublicTransport (which means that the person will be using public transportation in order to reach her/his destination) or PersonalVehicle (which means that person has a car and (s)he will be using this to reach the destination) or OnFeet (which means the person wants to reach the destination by walking). Transportation may contain all of them, few of them or only one. Because a destination can be reached by using different methods. For example, s/he may start the travel with PersonalVehicle and after leaving her/his car in a suitable place, s/he may go on with plane to the final destination. In the PublicTransport options, there are departure and arrival subcategories. These represent the process of going from the initial location to the destination point and from the destination point to the initial point respectively. However, it may be one direction in any transport type. In both, there are DateTime (the date that the transport's departure/arrival will take place), Price (the money that is paid for that transport type for that exact date), BookingLink (the link that was used in order to buy the ticket in order to use that transport type in that exact date). For PersonalVehicle, there are Waypoints which represent the places that are visited by the user in his/her way to the destination. In Waypoints, there are Waypoint elements that represent a specific place such as a restaurant, park, school. Because a person can use his/her car to stop by many places. Each waypoint has its Location, DateTime (the time of the visiting takes place), Tags (the variables that represent the the place. There will be more information related to tags in the following parts of this text.), Comments (the comments that are wrote by the people who experienced being in that place or who wish to criticise/praise the place). In the Comments, there are ID (the comment's ID to be able to seperate it from the other comments), Writer (the person's nickname whom wrote that specific comment), DateTime (the date that the comment was made), Rate (the score that the person gave to the place in order to assess there), Text (the comment that is visible by the other users). The Writer has Name (the username of the person who made the comment in the current platform) and Reviews (the reviews for that comment) in it. In Reviews there are Count (the count of the views that comment had from the users in that platform), Photo(?) and Link (the link of that comment). Accommodation is the place that the person(s) will stay at the reached destination or any other destinations such as waypoints. This may have many values since that person(s) may stay at different places at different destinations. Accommodation has 3 types as stated before. If there is Hotels, there should be the spesific hotels in Hotels part. Each hotel has similar properties with the waypoints. The same ones are Location, DateTime, Tags, Price, Comments. These are the versions that are adapted for hotels instead of waypoints. Hotels has also one other subcategory named Period which has the value of the two dates (first and last day) that the person will be staying at that specific hotel.

#Outputs of Definition 1#
You should be classifying all these input information into a json file which is similar to that of #json file#. Base information will be created from the #First Input Given for Definition 1# given. The other details will be filled with the additional information that is provided by user's text. Especially, focus on the "tags" of the json file.
